# This is a todo web app that was built using Docker(3 main containers [django, react, pgsql])
To build this app on your own machine:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/thongnd0200/Deploy-React-Django-PgSQL-WebApp-Using-Docker.git
$ cd Deploy-React-Django-PgSQL-WebApp-Using-Docker
# this command will take some minutes
$ docker-compose up 
```
To check does docker work or not:
```
# this command will list all the containers
$ docker ps
```
Then go to your browser and access:
`localhost:3000` or `127.0.0.1:3000`
